            <li>Equity Awards. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any equity incentive awards previously granted to Executive (the "Existing Equity Awards"), the award agreements and the equity incentive plans pursuant to which such awards were granted will continue to govern and, except as specifically provided in Section 8, this Agreement does not amend or replace any of the terms and conditions of such awards.</li>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="10">
            <li>Section 280G. To the extent that any payments to be made to Executive under this Agreement or the acceleration of the vesting of any of the option and equity awards contemplated by this Agreement that may occur as a result of a Change in Control could subject such amounts to the provisions of Section 280G of the Code, then, to the extent the Company is not publicly-traded for purposes of the applicable regulations at such time, the Company and Executive shall attempt in good faith to obtain, if requested by Executive, a shareholder vote under circumstances that satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code in order to avoid adverse tax consequences for the Company and Executive under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, provided Executive waives Executive's right to retain any parachute payments submitted to a vote in the event that the stockholders do not approve such payments. If such shareholder approval is not obtained or available, the options and equity awards (or portions thereof) that accelerate and other payments shall be reduced in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A if, and solely to the extent that, such reduction will cause Executive to retain, on an after-tax basis and after taking into account any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, a greater amount of the shares subject to such option and equity awards and other payments than would be the case if there were no such reduction. Any determination of such reduction shall be made by an accounting firm selected by the Company and agreed to by Executive, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld; such determination shall be binding upon the Company and Executive; and the fees of such firm shall be paid by the Company.</li>

            <li>Indemnification. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, at all times, ensure that Executive and Executive's services to the Company and its affiliates are covered pursuant to a customary director's and officer's insurance policy. In addition to any other rights to indemnification Executive may have, the Company hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Executive harmless, to the maximum extent allowed by law, from any and all liability for acts or omissions by Executive performed in any capacity in the course of Executive's employment (or reasonably believed by Executive to be within the scope of employment), or at the request of Executive or the Company; provided that such acts or omissions do not constitute (a) criminal conduct, (b) willful misconduct, or (c) fraud. Such indemnity shall include any and all cost, expense, and damages incurred by reason of Executive being made a party to or being a witness or otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. <span style="background-color: #00ff00;">The Company shall promptly pay as incurred all Executive's expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel of Executive's choosing) incurred in any matter as to which Executive is entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement or otherwise and neither Executive nor the Company shall amend, alter, or rescind the indemnification provisions of the Company's articles of incorporation or bylaws that would have the direct or indirect effect of diminishing or reducing the potential or actual protection or benefits under this Section 11. So long as the Company maintains any policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance (or any similar or successor policy), and for a period of three (3) years after the termination of Executive's employment, the Company shall include Executive as a named insured on each such policy with coverage and benefits no less favorable than those provided to then current senior officers and directors.</span></li>

The Parties intend for the payments and benefits under this Agreement to be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A") or, if not so exempt, to be paid or provided in a manner which complies with the requirements of such section, and intend that this Agreement shall be construed and administered in accordance with such intention. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of any payments under this Agreement which are subject to Section 409A until Executive would be considered to have incurred a separation from service from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A (a "Separation"). Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement or any other arrangement between Executive and Company during the six-month period immediately following Executive's Separation shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following Executive's Separation (or, if earlier, Executive's date of death). To the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, amounts reimbursable to Executive under this Agreement or any other arrangement between Executive and Company shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in kind benefits provided to Executive) during one year may not affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year. <span style="background-color: #00ff00;">Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, to the extent that any severance amount payable under a plan or agreement that Executive may have a right or entitlement to as of the date of this Agreement constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A, then to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, the portion of the benefits payable hereunder equal to such other amount shall instead be provided in the form set forth in such other plan or agreement.</span> The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described in this Agreement will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to any such payment. <span style="background-color: #ff0000;">Executive shall be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and penalties incurred under Section 409A of the Code.</span></li>
